## My Rick and Morty react app

Welcome to my react app that I made for the sci-fi comedy animation Rick and Morty! Here I've used an API with a graphQL endpoint to show the episodes, characters and locations involved with the series. Feel free to clone and have a look for yourself

# How to use

Installation- first, you will need to clone this repository. To do this, go to a location that you'd like to download it to using the command line, then use 'git clone' followed by the link for this repository.

If you're not used to using github as much, simply paste the following command into your command line:

git clone https://github.com/BenSymons/Rick-and-Morty.git

After you have done that, open the repository in VS code or whichever editor you prefer to use. You'll need to download all the dependencies before you can use it. These are just the libraries that I've downloaded that is needed to run it. To do this just type:

npm install

into your terminal. This should take less than a minute.

After that, type:

npm start

into your terminal to launch the app. This should open up in a new webpage in your browser. That's it! Use the nav bar at the top to navigate and I hope you enjoy my app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
